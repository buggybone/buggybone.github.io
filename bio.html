        <div class="header">Welcome to Ryan's Biography!</div>
        <p>
            Ryan was born in Mukilteo, WA in the mid 1980s. His childhood weekends 
            were filled with trips to family cabins on Hat Island and in Leavenworth, WA. 
            Ryan passed the time doing things like skiing, playing Magic: The Gathering, building legos, 
            and playing video games.

            He attended local schools until he was accepted at the University of Rochester in 
            Rochester, NY. Traveling across the country to Rochester, he started as an electrical engineering 
            major but switched to physics and math after getting sick of solving Kirchoff's Law problems. 
            After graduating with highest distinction, he traveled across the country again, this time to 
            Pasadena, CA to study physics at Caltech.

            Having enjoyed being a TA, Ryan decided to try teaching high school. He was hired to teach physics 
            at Claremont High School. This was mostly fun, but also exhausting. It was a privilege to help kids 
            achieve their goals, and to share his passion for the sciences. After 11 years of teaching students, 
            many of whom went on to do computer science and make more money than him, Ryan decided to scratch 
            an itch he'd been having for awhile and go back to school, enrolling in the Tufts computer science 
            masters program.

            Ryan has a 13 year old Boston Terrier named Bugger who is his best friend. He also has
            a younger brother who is a CPA, an aging dad who refuses to retire from 
            his kitchen cabinet company job, and a mom who loves word games.
